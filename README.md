# rock_paper_scissors
Another project from the Odin Project. This time it is focused more on Java than CSS or HTML.

This is going to be my first project using JavaScript. I hope everything goes well. I kinda zoned out in some of the videos so lets hope I still have most of the information. Im going to be working more on commits and their messages. Welp, lets do this!

//Final Thoughts//

I finally finished??? It was very confusing at first but in the end I did get the hang of it. I know my coding still came out very messy but I'm at least happy it came out functional. My commit messages needed more work. I was more focused on trying to complete the code rather than committing(thats going to be a habit I need to break). In the end though, I am happy with this project. It came out well and it looks half decent on the webpage.
