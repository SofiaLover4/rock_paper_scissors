# rock_paper_scissors
Another project from the Odin Project. This time it is focused more on Java than CSS or HTML.

This is going to be my first project using JavaScript. I hope everything goes well. I kinda zoned out in some of the videos so lets hope I still have most of the information. Im going to be working more on commits and their messages. Welp, lets do this!
